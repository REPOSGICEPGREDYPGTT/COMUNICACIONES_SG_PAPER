# A Connectivity Strategy for the Evaluation of Smart Grid Models Based on the Ethernet Technology

A connectivity strategy that enables data transmission between the components of a Smart Grid is proposed in this paper. The proposed connectivity strategy was validated by establishing the communication between simulation and embedded systems via the real Ethernet network, using the Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) technique. In the case study, an example of the control of a Smart Grid protection system was implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and a Texas Instruments development kit. Simulation results show that the proposed connectivity strategy could estimate the communication delays for different scenarios. This repository has the source code of the case study presented in the paper in MATLAB/Simulink and C for the Texas Instruments development kit.
