# A Connectivity Strategy for the Evaluation of Smart Grid Models Based on the Ethernet Technology

A simulation strategy that enables data transmission between the modeled components of a Smart Grid is proposed in this paper. The proposed simulation strategy, the connectivity strategy, was validated by establishing the communication between simulation and embedded systems via a physical Ethernet network, using the Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) technique. In the case study, control of a protection scheme in a Smart Grid was implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and a Texas Instruments development kit. Simulation results show that the proposed connectivity strategy could estimate the communication delays for different simulation scenarios.
